    <h3>Sasona</h3>
    <p> Sasona is a cute little co-op located in South Austin. I rebuilt Sasona's website since many prospective members had negative things to say about the old one. I wanted to make the new site more user-friendly. I think everyone is happier with the new site at <a href="https://sasona.org" target="_blank">Sasona.org</a></p>
    
    <h3>Intel Joule Hackathon November 2016</h3>
    <p>I'm hoping to pick this project back up. For the Intel Joule Hackathon, I worked on programing the Intel Joule to receive distance data from a camera a cyclists can clip on the back of their helmet. They would receive a vibration in the helmet to let them know there is an object accelerating behind them and they should move over. If there was a collision the camera would store the video and upload it to the "Cloud" where the user can retrieve the video from a web or app portal. This project is incomplete. </p>

    <h3>StartOut hackathon February 2015</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://startout.org" target="_blank">StartOut </a> is a non-profit advocating for LGBTQ entrepreneurs, and they host hackathons in various locations. I joined a group called "Follow the Music". We created a prototype for an app that would play music in the direction you needed to turn as a part of your directions. I created the User Interface in Proto.io</p>
